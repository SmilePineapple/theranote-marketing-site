# Workflow Routine

This file tracks the development workflow and completed tasks for the TheraNote Pro marketing site.

## Latest Update - Domain Transfer Process (Terminal Commands Attempted)

**DOMAIN TRANSFER INVESTIGATION COMPLETED**:

**TERMINAL COMMANDS EXECUTED**:
1. ‚úÖ `vercel projects ls` - Confirmed projects:
   - theranote-marketing: https://theranote.co.uk (OLD PROJECT)
   - marketing-site-nextjs: -- (NEW PROJECT, no domain)

2. ‚úÖ `vercel domains ls` - Shows 0 domains (domain not visible in current scope)

3. ‚ùå `vercel domains rm theranote.co.uk --scope=theranote-marketing` - Error: scope doesn't exist

4. ‚ùå `vercel domains remove theranote.co.uk` - Error: Domain not found under current account

5. ‚úÖ `vercel link` - Successfully linked marketing-site-nextjs project

6. ‚ùå `vercel domains add theranote.co.uk` - Error: Domain already assigned to another project (CONFIRMED)

7. ‚ùå `vercel --prod` - CLI hangs again (same authentication/connectivity issue)

**FINDINGS**:
- ‚úÖ Domain conflict confirmed: theranote.co.uk is assigned to theranote-marketing
- ‚ùå CLI domain management commands don't work across projects in this setup
- ‚ùå Vercel CLI continues to have authentication/connectivity issues
- ‚úÖ Project linking successful, ready for deployment

**SOLUTION REQUIRED**: Manual Vercel Dashboard domain transfer

**NEXT STEPS**:
1. **MANUAL DASHBOARD PROCESS** (CLI commands insufficient):
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí theranote-marketing project
   - Remove theranote.co.uk domain from old project
   - Go to marketing-site-nextjs project
   - Add theranote.co.uk domain to new project
   - Deploy new project

2. **ALTERNATIVE**: Use GitHub integration for deployment (more reliable than CLI)

### Previous Investigation History
- ‚úÖ Resolved multiple TypeScript build errors by installing missing @types packages
- ‚úÖ Updated vercel.json to include redirect rule for theranote.co.uk domain
- ‚úÖ Identified domain assignment: theranote.co.uk is assigned to 'theranote-marketing' project
- ‚úÖ Current project 'marketing-site-nextjs' is separate from domain-assigned project
- ‚úÖ Confirmed Vercel CLI authentication (user: jakedalerourke-7711)
- ‚úÖ Build issues resolved - TypeScript compilation successful
- ‚úÖ Domain theranote.co.uk exists in Vercel account (37 days old)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Vercel CLI deployment commands consistently hanging/timing out
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Domain connection test failed (curl timeout to theranote.co.uk)

### Technical Findings
- Domain: theranote.co.uk (Third Party registrar, Third Party nameservers)
- Assigned Project: theranote-marketing (https://theranote.co.uk)
- Current Project: marketing-site-nextjs (linked to prj_pJCBAWyTMSqq8ArW3cKjogT6jTh7)
- Vercel CLI Version: 48.0.3

### Deployment Attempts Made
- Multiple npx vercel --prod attempts (all hanging after CLI initialization)
- Attempted domain reassignment (blocked - domain already assigned)
- Attempted forced deployment with --force flag (hanging)
- All CLI commands stop responding after "Vercel CLI 48.0.3" message
- ‚úÖ Updated Vercel CLI to version 48.0.3
- ‚úÖ Confirmed static build works locally (tested with Python HTTP server)
- ‚úÖ Identified complex vercel.json configuration as potential issue
- ‚úÖ Tested deployment with simplified and no vercel.json - CLI still hangs
- ‚úÖ Confirmed Vercel API connectivity (curl tests successful)
- ‚úÖ Verified authentication working (vercel whoami successful)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Consistent CLI hanging at initialization stage across all deployment methods

### Current Deployment Status (Latest - 2025-01-19)
- **Issue**: Vercel CLI consistently hangs after displaying "Vercel CLI 48.0.3"
- **Root Cause**: Unknown - appears to be system-level CLI issue, not configuration
- **Build Status**: ‚úÖ Fresh build completed successfully (no errors)
- **Project Structure**: ‚úÖ Verified marketing-site-nextjs directory and .vercel/project.json
- **Project Linking**: ‚úÖ Successfully linked to marketing-site-nextjs project (prj_pJCBAWyTMSqq8ArW3cKjogT6jTh7)
- **Vercel Config**: ‚úÖ Restored vercel.json from backup with proper configuration
- **CLI Attempts**: ‚ùå Multiple deployment attempts failed (npx vercel --prod, npx vercel deploy)
- **Current Status**: marketing-site-nextjs.vercel.app returns "DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND"

### Recommended Solutions (Priority Order)
1. **Manual Vercel Dashboard Deployment**:
   - Go to vercel.com dashboard
   - Import project from GitHub or upload folder
   - Connect theranote.co.uk domain to marketing-site-nextjs project
   - Remove domain from theranote-marketing project first

2. **GitHub Integration Deployment**:
   - Push marketing-site-nextjs to GitHub repository
   - Connect Vercel to GitHub repo for automatic deployments
   - Configure domain in Vercel dashboard

3. **Alternative CLI Troubleshooting**:
   - Try vercel login --force to refresh authentication
   - Clear Vercel CLI cache: rm -rf ~/.vercel
   - Try different terminal or shell environment

Based on your Vercel dashboard screenshots, I can see both projects are available. Here's what you need to do RIGHT NOW:

**STEP 1: Remove Domain from Old Project**
1. ‚úÖ You can see "theranote-marketing" project in your dashboard
2. Click on the "theranote-marketing" project
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Domains
4. Find "theranote.co.uk" in the domains list
5. Click the three dots (‚ãØ) next to theranote.co.uk
6. Select "Remove" to remove the domain from this project
7. Confirm the removal

**STEP 2: Add Domain to New Project**
1. ‚úÖ You can see "marketing-site-nextjs" project in your dashboard
2. Click on the "marketing-site-nextjs" project
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Domains
4. Click "Add Domain"
5. Enter "theranote.co.uk"
6. Click "Add"
7. Vercel will automatically detect the existing DNS configuration

**STEP 3: Deploy to Production**
1. In the marketing-site-nextjs project, go to the "Deployments" tab
2. Click "Deploy" or "Redeploy" to create a production deployment
3. Wait for the deployment to complete (should take 1-2 minutes)

**STEP 4: Verify Domain**
1. Once deployment is complete, visit https://theranote.co.uk
2. Confirm it shows the new marketing site content
3. Check that all pages load correctly (/features, /pricing, /security)

**üéØ DNS Configuration Status:**
- ‚úÖ CNAME record already set to: 4b94a931cd5a0d39.vercel-dns-017.com
- ‚úÖ No DNS changes needed - just domain transfer between projects

### üìã Current Status (Jan 31, 2025)
- ‚úÖ Build completed successfully
- ‚úÖ Git refresh completed successfully
- ‚úÖ Project ready for deployment
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Vercel CLI authentication expired - manual dashboard required
- üîÑ **AWAITING USER ACTION**: Manual domain transfer in Vercel dashboard
- ‚è≥ Production deployment pending (via dashboard)
- ‚è≥ Domain verification pending
- ‚úÖ DNS Configuration: CNAME record set to 4b94a931cd5a0d39.vercel-dns-017.com
