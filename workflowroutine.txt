# Workflow Routine

This file tracks the development workflow and completed tasks for the TheraNote Pro marketing site.

## Latest Update - Domain Transfer Process (Terminal Commands Attempted)

**DOMAIN TRANSFER INVESTIGATION COMPLETED**:

**TERMINAL COMMANDS EXECUTED**:
1. ‚úÖ `vercel projects ls` - Confirmed projects:
   - theranote-marketing: https://theranote.co.uk (OLD PROJECT)
   - marketing-site-nextjs: -- (NEW PROJECT, no domain)

2. ‚úÖ `vercel domains ls` - Shows 0 domains (domain not visible in current scope)

3. ‚ùå `vercel domains rm theranote.co.uk --scope=theranote-marketing` - Error: scope doesn't exist

4. ‚ùå `vercel domains remove theranote.co.uk` - Error: Domain not found under current account

5. ‚úÖ `vercel link` - Successfully linked marketing-site-nextjs project

6. ‚ùå `vercel domains add theranote.co.uk` - Error: Domain already assigned to another project (CONFIRMED)

7. ‚ùå `vercel --prod` - CLI hangs again (same authentication/connectivity issue)

**FINDINGS**:
- ‚úÖ Domain conflict confirmed: theranote.co.uk is assigned to theranote-marketing
- ‚ùå CLI domain management commands don't work across projects in this setup
- ‚ùå Vercel CLI continues to have authentication/connectivity issues
- ‚úÖ Project linking successful, ready for deployment

**SOLUTION REQUIRED**: Manual Vercel Dashboard domain transfer

**NEXT STEPS**:
1. **MANUAL DASHBOARD PROCESS** (CLI commands insufficient):
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí theranote-marketing project
   - Remove theranote.co.uk domain from old project
   - Go to marketing-site-nextjs project
   - Add theranote.co.uk domain to new project
   - Deploy new project

2. **ALTERNATIVE**: Use GitHub integration for deployment (more reliable than CLI)

### Previous Investigation History
- ‚úÖ Resolved multiple TypeScript build errors by installing missing @types packages
- ‚úÖ Updated vercel.json to include redirect rule for theranote.co.uk domain
- ‚úÖ Identified domain assignment: theranote.co.uk is assigned to 'theranote-marketing' project
- ‚úÖ Current project 'marketing-site-nextjs' is separate from domain-assigned project
- ‚úÖ Confirmed Vercel CLI authentication (user: jakedalerourke-7711)
- ‚úÖ Build issues resolved - TypeScript compilation successful
- ‚úÖ Domain theranote.co.uk exists in Vercel account (37 days old)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Vercel CLI deployment commands consistently hanging/timing out
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Domain connection test failed (curl timeout to theranote.co.uk)

### Technical Findings
- Domain: theranote.co.uk (Third Party registrar, Third Party nameservers)
- Assigned Project: theranote-marketing (https://theranote.co.uk)
- Current Project: marketing-site-nextjs (linked to prj_pJCBAWyTMSqq8ArW3cKjogT6jTh7)
- Vercel CLI Version: 48.0.3

### Deployment Attempts Made
- Multiple npx vercel --prod attempts (all hanging after CLI initialization)
- Attempted domain reassignment (blocked - domain already assigned)
- Attempted forced deployment with --force flag (hanging)
- All CLI commands stop responding after "Vercel CLI 48.0.3" message
- ‚úÖ Updated Vercel CLI to version 48.0.3
- ‚úÖ Confirmed static build works locally (tested with Python HTTP server)
- ‚úÖ Identified complex vercel.json configuration as potential issue
- ‚úÖ Tested deployment with simplified and no vercel.json - CLI still hangs
- ‚úÖ Confirmed Vercel API connectivity (curl tests successful)
- ‚úÖ Verified authentication working (vercel whoami successful)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Consistent CLI hanging at initialization stage across all deployment methods

### Current Deployment Status (Latest - 2025-01-19)
- **Issue**: Vercel CLI consistently hangs after displaying "Vercel CLI 48.0.3"
- **Root Cause**: Unknown - appears to be system-level CLI issue, not configuration
- **Build Status**: ‚úÖ Fresh build completed successfully (no errors)
- **Project Structure**: ‚úÖ Verified marketing-site-nextjs directory and .vercel/project.json
- **Project Linking**: ‚úÖ Successfully linked to marketing-site-nextjs project (prj_pJCBAWyTMSqq8ArW3cKjogT6jTh7)
- **Vercel Config**: ‚úÖ Restored vercel.json from backup with proper configuration
- **CLI Attempts**: ‚ùå Multiple deployment attempts failed (npx vercel --prod, npx vercel deploy)
- **Current Status**: marketing-site-nextjs.vercel.app returns "DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND"

### Recommended Solutions (Priority Order)
1. **Manual Vercel Dashboard Deployment**:
   - Go to vercel.com dashboard
   - Import project from GitHub or upload folder
   - Connect theranote.co.uk domain to marketing-site-nextjs project
   - Remove domain from theranote-marketing project first

2. **GitHub Integration Deployment**:
   - Push marketing-site-nextjs to GitHub repository
   - Connect Vercel to GitHub repo for automatic deployments
   - Configure domain in Vercel dashboard

3. **Alternative CLI Troubleshooting**:
   - Try vercel login --force to refresh authentication
   - Clear Vercel CLI cache: rm -rf ~/.vercel
   - Try different terminal or shell environment
